I am an associate professor of Mathematics at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy (USCGA).  The undergraduate major offered by our department is Operations Research and Computer Analysis (ORCA).  I have had a wide range of teaching experiences across over a dozen different courses in a variety of formats, numerous senior capstone projects and several directed studies.   I have taught hundreds of students how to apply mathematical decision-making tools to real-world problems.  I strive to innovate in the classroom with an eye towards two of the key tenets of my teaching philosophy:  to make the learning relevant to the student and to scaffold project-based learning.
