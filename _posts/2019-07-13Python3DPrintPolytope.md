In earlier posts, I wrote about my experiences [visualizing](https://greenor.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/visualizing-lps-in-mathematica/) and [3D printing](https://greenor.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/3d-printing-an-lp-feasible-region/) polytopes using *Mathematica*.
I am coming at these polytopes as feasible regions of 3-variable linear progams (LP). In a [related post about using the same "tool chain" to print solids from Calculus examples](http://ifrommer.github.io/3DPrintVolume/), I wrote:
